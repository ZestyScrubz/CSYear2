1. Files:
    1. We can use dir, since it displace all the content in the current direction
        We can also use echo *. The "*" matches all non-hidden files and directories in the current directory and echo prints that list to the terminal
    2. The option -i is used prompt before every removal, for directories, we can use the recursive option -r
        To ensure we are not prompted we can use -f which ignores nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt, and addtionally we can add -r for directories
        The -f option takes precedence, so we will not be prompted when removing
    3. The primary purpose of mv is to move files or directories from one location to another, or remanes them. While the main purpose of rename is to rename
        multiple files using pattern matching.
        mv cannot rename multiple files while rename can. rename cannot moves files between directories while mv can. mv does not use pattern-based renaming
    4. In this context, ELF stands for "Executable and Linkable Format", which is a standrd file format used for executable, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems
